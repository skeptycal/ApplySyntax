Pull requests are welcome for back-porting features, enhancements, or fixes to the old branch, but the content of the pull must already exist on the main, actively developed branch. I will not allow an older branch to exceed the main branch in regards to functionality. ST3 Fully supported and actively maintained. Contribution from the community is encouraged and can be done in a variety of ways: Bug reports. Reviewing code. Code patches via pull requests. Documentation improvements via pull requests. Bug Reports \ue157 Please read the documentation and search the issue tracker to try to find the answer to your question before posting an issue. When creating an issue on the repository, please provide as much info as possible: Provide environment information by running Preferences->Package Settings->ApplySyntax->Support Info . The information will be copied to the clipboard; paste the info in issue. Errors in console. Detailed description of the problem. Examples for reproducing the error. You can post pictures, but if specific text or code is required to reproduce the issue, please provide the text in a plain text format as well for easy copy/paste. The more info provided the greater the chance someone will take the time to answer, implement, or fix the issue. Be prepared to answer questions and provide additional information if required. Issues in which the creator refuses to respond to follow up questions will be marked as stale and closed. Reviewing Code \ue157 Take part in reviewing pull requests and/or reviewing direct commits. Make suggestions to improve the code and discuss solutions to overcome weakness in the algorithm. Pull Requests \ue157 Pull requests are welcome, and if you plan on contributing directly to the code, there are a couple of things to be mindful of. Please describe the change in as much detail as possible so I can understand what is being added or modified. If you are solving a bug that does not already have an issue, please describe the bug in detail and provide info on how to reproduce if applicable (this is good for me and others to reference later when verifying the issue has been resolved). Please reference and link related open bugs or feature requests in this pull if applicable. Make sure you've documented or updated the existing documentation if introducing a new feature or modifying the behavior of an existing feature that a user needs to be aware of. I will not accept new features or changes to existing features if you have not provided documentation describing the feature. Continuous integration tests on are run on all pull requests and commits via Travis CI. When making a pull request, the tests will automatically be run, and the request must pass to be accepted. You can (and should) run these tests before pull requesting. If it is not possible to run these tests locally, they will be run when the pull request is made, but it is strongly suggested that requesters make an effort to verify before requesting to allow for a quick, smooth merge. Running Validation Tests \ue157 Tip If you are running Sublime on a macOS or Linux/Unix system, you run all tests by by running the shell script (assuming you have installed your environment fulfills all requirements below): chmod +x run_tests.sh ./run_tests.sh There are a couple of dependencies that must be present before running the tests. As ST3 is the only current, actively supported version, Python 3.3 must be used to validate the tests. Unit tests are run with pytest . You can install pytest via: pip install pytest The tests should be run from the root folder of the plugin by using the following command: py.test . Linting is performed on the entire project with flake8 , flake8_docstrings , pep8-naming . These can be installed via: pip install flake8 pip install flake8_docstrings pip install pep8-naming Linting is performed with the following command: flake8 . Documentation Improvements \ue157 A ton of time has been spent not only creating and supporting this plugin, but also spent making this documentation. If you feel it is still lacking, show your appreciation for the plugin by helping to improve the documentation. Help with documentation is always appreciated and can be done via pull requests. There shouldn't be any need to run validation tests if only updating documentation. You don't have to render the docs locally before pull requesting, but if you wish to, I currently use a combination of MkDocs , the Material theme , and PyMdown Extensions to render the docs. You can preview the docs if you install these two packages. The command for previewing the docs is mkdocs serve from the root directory.

You define the rules, the plugin checks them. The first one to pass wins. ApplySyntax allows you to create your own custom rules. The easiest way to get started is to create a settings file called ApplySyntax.sublime-settings in your Packages/User folder. You can override the default settings in Packages/ApplySyntax/ApplySyntax.sublime-settings by setting them in your Packages/User/ApplySyntax.sublime-settings file. You can override any setting to meet your needs. To prepend rules to the default rule set, you can create a key called syntaxes (modifying default_syntaxes will wipe out all the default rules and is not recommended as you won't get the latest updates). Creating Rules \ue157 Each rule is a dictionary within the syntax array. Let's take a look at the top level parameters. Syntax \ue157 The syntax attribute is the syntax file that will be applied to a view which meets the criteria defined in the rule. For syntax files you must specify the path to the syntax file. The plugin is capable of supporting multiple levels of folder nesting if you need it to. For example, if you had all of your tmLanguage files for Rails organized in a folder like this: Packages/Rails/Language/*.tmLanguage , and you were looking to use the Ruby Haml.tmLanguage file, the path to name translation would simply be: Packages/Rails/Language/Ruby Haml.tmLanguage \u2192 Rails/Language/Ruby Haml . \"syntax\" : \"Rails/Language/Ruby Haml\" Notice that the paths are relative to the Packages folder. Also, notice that we don't specify the extension. Sublime Text in build 3084 added a new language syntax with the extension sublime-syntax . In Sublime builds >= 3084, ApplySyntax will first default to sublime-syntax and fall back to tmLanguage if it cannot find the the other format. If you want to force the syntax, just specify the extension; the extension must be either sublime-syntax or tmLanguage . \"syntax\" : \"Rails/Language/Ruby Haml.tmLanguage\" If it is desirable for the syntax rule to reference multiple tmLanguage files because it is not known which package will be on a machine, you can set the syntax as an array of syntaxes as shown in the following example. The first one found will be used. \"syntax\" : [ \"RSpec/RSpec\" , \"RSpec (snippets and syntax)/Syntaxes/RSpec\" ] Notice that each syntax file has a different path since they come from completely different plugins. Lastly, if using Package Control, it is likely that most, if not all, of your packages will be zipped with the extension .sublime-package in the Installed Packages folder instead of Packages . These will be handled exactly like plugins installed under Packages . The one difference is that you treat the zip bundle as a folder without the .sublime-package extension. So if we had a syntax file located in a zipped bundle: Installed Packages/Rails.sublime-package/Language/Ruby Haml.tmLanguage \u2192 Rails/Language/Ruby Haml . \"syntax\" : \"Rails/Language/Ruby Haml\" Deprecation The previous name for this key was name and has been deprecated and will be removed in the future. Extensions \ue157 The extensions attribute is used to define extensions to apply a syntax to. extensions is an array of strings where each string is an extension. No . is needed when defining extensions, unless it is desired to target a dot file like .gitignore , then you would include the . . { \"syntax\" : \"YAML/YAML\" , \"extensions\" : [ \".gemrc\" , \"yml\" , \"yml.dist\" ] }, extensions is evaluated before all other rules, and it never takes part in \" match all \" rule sets as it is run separate from the normal rule sets; if an extension is matched here, all other rules will be skipped. An added benefit of extensions , if you are using ST3 and set add_exts_to_lang_settings to true , is that ApplySyntax will add the extensions to the specified syntax language's settings file in your User folder. By doing this, Sublime Text will be able to show the associated icon for the file type in the sidebar. Apply syntax will also create a file ApplySyntax.ext-list in your User folder and track which extension it added so that if you remove a rule, ApplySyntax will only remove the extensions it added to the language file in question. If you do not like this functionality, you can simply disable add_exts_to_lang_settings by setting it to false . !!! note \"Note\": add_exts_to_lang_settings will not be applied to extensions found in a project specific rule , as project specific rules are not global, but the effects of add_exts_to_lang_settings are global. Match \ue157 match is a setting that you either include or omit. When included, you set it to all . When set, all rules defined must be met for a match to be considered successful. match ignores the extensions key as extensions never take part in \"match all\" rule sets. If you want to include an extension rule in a \"match all\" rule set, then a file_path rule should be used. \"match\" : \"all\" So in this case, all the rules must match for the syntax to be applied: \"syntax\" : \"Handlebars/Handlebars\" , \"match\" : \"all\" , \"rules\" : [ { \"file_path\" : \".*\\\\.html$\" }, { \"contains\" : \"<script [^>]*type=\\\"text\\\\/x-handlebars\\\"[^>]*>\" } ] In this case, there is no match key, so only one rule needs to match: { \"syntax\" : \"Ruby/Ruby\" , \"rules\" : [ { \"file_path\" : \".*(\\\\\\\\|/)Gemfile$\" }, { \"file_path\" : \".*(\\\\\\\\|/)Capfile$\" }, { \"file_path\" : \".*(\\\\\\\\|/)Guardfile$\" }, { \"file_path\" : \".*(\\\\\\\\|/)[Rr]akefile$\" }, { \"file_path\" : \".*(\\\\\\\\|/)Berksfile$\" }, { \"file_path\" : \".*(\\\\\\\\|/)[Cc]heffile$\" }, { \"file_path\" : \".*(\\\\\\\\|/)Thorfile$\" }, { \"file_path\" : \".*(\\\\\\\\|/)Podfile$\" }, { \"file_path\" : \".*(\\\\\\\\|/)config.ru$\" }, { \"file_path\" : \".*\\\\\\\\Vagrantfile(\\\\\\\\..*)?$\" }, { \"file_path\" : \".*/Vagrantfile(/..*)?$\" }, { \"file_path\" : \".*\\\\.thor$\" }, { \"file_path\" : \".*\\\\.rake$\" }, { \"file_path\" : \".*\\\\.simplecov$\" }, { \"file_path\" : \".*\\\\.jbuilder$\" }, { \"file_path\" : \".*\\\\.rb$\" }, { \"file_path\" : \".*\\\\.podspec$\" }, { \"file_path\" : \".*\\\\.rabl$\" }, { \"interpreter\" : \"ruby\" } ] }, Rules \ue157 rules is an array of rules that can be used to target specific files with your defined syntax file. The rules are processed until the first rule matches, so order your rules in a way that makes sense to you. File Path Rule \ue157 A file_path rule defines a regex to match against the complete file path. The pattern is always anchored to the beginning of the path, as if there were an implicit ^ \u2014 so the pattern /a/b/c will match the file /a/b/c/foo.py , but not the file /x/y/z/a/b/c/foo.py . (You may include an explicit ^ at the beginning of the pattern, as some of the default rules do \u2014 but the result is the same either way.) For backwards compatibility with older versions of ApplySyntax, the rule name file_name is also accepted, and functions exactly like file_path . { \"file_path\" : \".*\\\\.xml(\\\\.dist)?$\" }, Deprecation The previous name for this key was file_name and has been deprecated and will be removed in the future. First Line Rule \ue157 A first_line rule allows you to check whether the first line of the file's content matches a given regex. As with file_path rules , the pattern is always anchored to the beginning of the line. { \"first_line\" : \"^<\\\\?xml\" }, Interpreter (Shebang) \ue157 An interpreter rule does the same thing as a first_line rule that uses a regex to match an interpreter directive (shebang). The difference being that ApplySyntax will construct the regex for you. So a first_line rule: { \"first_line\" : \"^#\\\\!(?:.+)ruby\" } Can be simplified as: { \"interpreter\" : \"ruby\" } For backwards compatibility with older versions of ApplySyntax, the rule name binary is also accepted, and functions exactly like interpreter . Deprecation The previous name for this key was binary and has been deprecated and will be removed in the future. Function Rule \ue157 This is an example of using a custom function to decide whether or not to apply a syntax. This is done via ApplySyntax plugins. The plugin file should be under a plugin folder. The function rule takes two parameters. The first is source and is the plugin source file. It is defined as if you were importing a python plugin. If you had a plugin in Packages/ApplySyntax/as_plugins/is_rails_file.py , it would be defined under source as ApplySyntax.as_plugins.is_rails_file . Function rules still support the legacy way: ApplySyntax/as_plugins/is_rails_file , but it is recommended to use the dot notation as it makes more sense from a Python import perspective. The second parameter is args and is optional. args is a dictionary of the keyword arguments the function rule plugin accepts. The plugin must have a function defined as syntax_test . syntax_test will be the function called within the plugin file and accepts an argument file_path (which is the full path to the file being evaluated), and any custom keyword arguments desired by the user. The plugin must return either True or False . { \"function\" : { \"source\" : \"User.plugins.myplugin\" , \"args\" : { 'foo' : \"bar\" }}} Example: def syntax_test ( file_path , foo ): # Some test logic return False # True or False Tip When placing a function rule module in a package, it is advised to put it in a sub-folder. The sub-folder does not need an __init__.py , it just needs your module(s). Deprecation Previously, function rules allowed for a name attribute which allowed the user to specify the function name to call in the plugin. In the current version, ApplySyntax looks for a function named syntax_test . While name is still currently supported, it has been deprecated, and will be removed in the future. Content Rule \ue157 Sometimes a file name or first line search is just not enough and maybe a function rule is overkill. In this case, maybe searching the content of a file can be enough. You can search a file's content with regex for a specific token via the contains rule. { \"contains\" : \"<script [^>]*type=\\\"text\\\\/x-handlebars\\\"[^>]*>\" } Tip It is recommended to pair contains rules with other rules via the \"match\" : \"all\" option to ensure you don't search every file (which can significantly slow down the editor); this will also help ensure get more reliable matches. If pairing with other rules as dependencies, it is advised to pair the contains rule after the other required rule(s) to ensure you search the content of as few files as possible. Also, try to use very specific regex to ensure you don't get false positives. Project Specific Rules \ue157 To define project specific syntaxes, just create a settings key in your project file (if it doesn't already exist) and then and an additional key under settings called project_syntaxes . project_syntaxes is an array; just add your syntax rules to project_syntaxes just like you would add them to syntaxes in your user settings file, and ApplySyntax will prepend the rules to the beginning of your defined rules. The order of rules is as follows: project \u2192 user \u2192 default. There is one difference between project specific rules and global rules. In project rules, the extensions key will not be applied to the associated syntax language settings file as project specific rules are not global, but language settings files are global. \"settings\" : { \"project_syntaxes\" : [ { \"syntax\" : \"XML/XML\" , \"rules\" : [ { \"file_path\" : \".*\\\\.xml(\\\\.dist)?$\" }, { \"first_line\" : \"^<\\\\?xml\" } ] } ] } Settings Options \ue157 There are a couple of general settings found in ApplySyntax.sublime-settings . Re-Raise Exceptions \ue157 If an exception occurs when processing a function, this will re-raised the captured exception in Sublime's console so the user get feedback. This is really only useful to those writing functions. The average user shouldn't need this. By default, the setting will be set to false . \"reraise_exceptions\" : false , New File Syntax \ue157 If you want to have a syntax applied when new files are created, set new_file_syntax to the name of the syntax to use. The format is exactly the same as the syntax parameter in the syntax rules mentioned earlier. For example, if you want to have a new file use JavaScript syntax, set new_file_syntax to JavaScript/JavaScript . The default is false . \"new_file_syntax\" : \"JavaScript/JavaScript\" , Add Extensions to Language Settings \ue157 To enable adding defined extensions to language settings, just set add_exts_to_lang_settings to true . See Extensions for more info. \"add_exts_to_lang_settings\" : true , Troubleshooting and Debugging \ue157 By default, the debug setting is turned on so that users have some form of visual feedback in the console that ApplySyntax is working. This can be turned off by setting debug to false . If developing, you can set debug to verbose to get even more info in the console. // Control level of logging in the console. // (true|false|\"verbose\") \"debug\" : true ,","title":"User Guide"},{"location":"usage/#user-guide","text":"","title":"User Guide"},{"location":"usage/#overview","text":"ApplySyntax is based on the idea of creating rules for applying certain syntaxes to specific files. You define the rules, the plugin checks them. The first one to pass wins. ApplySyntax allows you to create your own custom rules. The easiest way to get started is to create a settings file called ApplySyntax.sublime-settings in your Packages/User folder. You can override the default settings in Packages/ApplySyntax/ApplySyntax.sublime-settings by setting them in your Packages/User/ApplySyntax.sublime-settings file. You can override any setting to meet your needs. To prepend rules to the default rule set, you can create a key called syntaxes (modifying default_syntaxes will wipe out all the default rules and is not recommended as you won't get the latest updates).","title":"Overview"},{"location":"usage/#creating-rules","text":"Each rule is a dictionary within the syntax array. Let's take a look at the top level parameters.","title":"Creating Rules"},{"location":"usage/#syntax","text":"The syntax attribute is the syntax file that will be applied to a view which meets the criteria defined in the rule. For syntax files you must specify the path to the syntax file. The plugin is capable of supporting multiple levels of folder nesting if you need it to. For example, if you had all of your tmLanguage files for Rails organized in a folder like this: Packages/Rails/Language/*.tmLanguage , and you were looking to use the Ruby Haml.tmLanguage file, the path to name translation would simply be: Packages/Rails/Language/Ruby Haml.tmLanguage \u2192 Rails/Language/Ruby Haml . \"syntax\" : \"Rails/Language/Ruby Haml\" Notice that the paths are relative to the Packages folder. Also, notice that we don't specify the extension. Sublime Text in build 3084 added a new language syntax with the extension sublime-syntax . In Sublime builds >= 3084, ApplySyntax will first default to sublime-syntax and fall back to tmLanguage if it cannot find the the other format. If you want to force the syntax, just specify the extension; the extension must be either sublime-syntax or tmLanguage . \"syntax\" : \"Rails/Language/Ruby Haml.tmLanguage\" If it is desirable for the syntax rule to reference multiple tmLanguage files because it is not known which package will be on a machine, you can set the syntax as an array of syntaxes as shown in the following example. The first one found will be used. \"syntax\" : [ \"RSpec/RSpec\" , \"RSpec (snippets and syntax)/Syntaxes/RSpec\" ] Notice that each syntax file has a different path since they come from completely different plugins. Lastly, if using Package Control, it is likely that most, if not all, of your packages will be zipped with the extension .sublime-package in the Installed Packages folder instead of Packages . These will be handled exactly like plugins installed under Packages . The one difference is that you treat the zip bundle as a folder without the .sublime-package extension. So if we had a syntax file located in a zipped bundle: Installed Packages/Rails.sublime-package/Language/Ruby Haml.tmLanguage \u2192 Rails/Language/Ruby Haml . \"syntax\" : \"Rails/Language/Ruby Haml\" Deprecation The previous name for this key was name and has been deprecated and will be removed in the future.","title":"Syntax"},{"location":"usage/#extensions","text":"The extensions attribute is used to define extensions to apply a syntax to. extensions is an array of strings where each string is an extension.

An added benefit of extensions , if you are using ST3 and set add_exts_to_lang_settings to true , is that ApplySyntax will add the extensions to the specified syntax language's settings file in your User folder. By doing this, Sublime Text will be able to show the associated icon for the file type in the sidebar. Apply syntax will also create a file ApplySyntax.ext-list in your User folder and track which extension it added so that if you remove a rule, ApplySyntax will only remove the extensions it added to the language file in question. If you do not like this functionality, you can simply disable add_exts_to_lang_settings by setting it to false . !!! note \"Note\": add_exts_to_lang_settings will not be applied to extensions found in a project specific rule , as project specific rules are not global, but the effects of add_exts_to_lang_settings are global.","title":"Extensions"},{"location":"usage/#match","text":"match is a setting that you either include or omit.
